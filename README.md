# DAPP
I divide this file between the back end configuration ( java script- node.js //Solidity - hard hat ) and the client interface front end (javascript- react- css /tailwind**).
** I use front end template
1. I work with infura on the ethereum testnet for deploy the contract.
2. I used web3 library to establish conection with cripto wallet, in this case metemask because is the most popular and secure.
3. Solidity section: creating the contract that allows sending ether to another wallet.
4. The purpose is connect any wallet and send some ether amount to another address.
5. Finally below of the transaction part, i decided use a random images section with a VITE_GIPHY_API for store the last transacctions than users made.
