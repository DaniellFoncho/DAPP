# DAPP
I divide this file between the back end configuration ( java script- node.js //Solidity - hard hat ) and the client interface front end (javascript- react- css /tailwind**).
** I use front end template
I work with infura on the ethereum testnet for deploy the contract.
I used web3 library to establish conection with cripto wallet, in this case metemask because is the most popular and secure.
Solidity section: creating the contract that allows sending ether to another wallet.
the fincionality is connect my wallet for send some ether amount to another address,
Finally below of the transaction part, i decided use a random images section with a VITE_GIPHY_API for store the last transacctions than users made.
